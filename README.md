# Wingman Tournament Multimedia Relay

As far as I can tell, this is the lowest-cost, lowest-footprint CSGO tournament software that has ever been created.  I reached out to Prius, sAPPHIRe, and some other observers/casters at major CSGO tournaments, and they explained their system to me.  They have individual computers for each player that capture their Discord inputs and route them into an extremely expensive AV system.  They also have 2 computers for casting, and 2 for streaming.  Depending on the tournament, they use anywhere between 10-18 computers and a budget of $175,000 per event.  This whole system runs on one laptop and is lightweight enough to run on an iPad, since it takes advantage of distributed computing of the computers of the players themselves, while recognizing CPU load and easing back on transmitted video quality to dynamically avoid interferening with gameplay performance.  Eventually I will publish it under the ACAB license (Open source, unless you're a cop) under some flashy name, but for now it exists solely to run the Dangerous Men Wingman Tournament.
